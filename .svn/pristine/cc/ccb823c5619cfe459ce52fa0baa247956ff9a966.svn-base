        The main method in every Java program is passed in an array of strings 
        as a parameter, which are specified on the command line when executing 
        the program.
        
        In order for your AI to be able to connect to the BattleShip server, 
        you will need to construct an object of type Protocol with an instance 
        of your AI and the necessary server port number. To do so, follow the 
        steps outlined below.
        
     1) Create an instance of the class that you have created that implements 
        the BattleShipPlayer interface and store the reference with an 
        identifier of your choosing.
        
     2) The necessary port number will be provided as a command line argument 
        and be stored as a string as the first element in the args parameter 
        of this main method. You will need to parse that String to an int and 
        store the value with an identifier of your choosing.
        
     3) Create an instance of the Protocol class by using the constructor
        that takes two arguments. Use the identifiers that you have created 
        in parts 1 and 2 for the two parameters. Store the reference to 
        the Protocol object in an identifier of your choosing.
        
     4) Call the start method on the object reference from part 3. This 
        will attempt to connect to the BattleShip server and allow your AI 
        to participate in the competition.
        
            ** Note: Since the competetion portion of this assignment is 
            hosted on a server, you will not be able to run the project on 
            your computer to participate. In order to compete, you will need 
            to follow the competition submission instructions, which can be
            found within the lab08 Instructions document located under the 
            BattleShip heading.
