         *  For this part of the assignment you will be doing simple array
         *   processing on an array of type double with the identifier input
         *   that is being passed as a parameter to this method. 
         * 
         *  You should calculate and return the following values as elements of
         *   an array of type Object in the following order:
         * 
         *  1) An int value representing the count (number of elements in the input array)
         *  2) A double value representing the sum (total of elements in the input array)
         *  3) A double value representing the value of the smallest element in the input array
         *      *Note: If there are no elements, return the special value Double.NaN
         *  4) A double value representing the value of the largest element in the input array
         *      *Note: If there are no elements, return the special value Double.NaN
